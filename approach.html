        <h2>Problem Solving Approach</h2>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for problem-solving and algorithm design. I have actively participated in competitive programming on platforms like CodeChef and HackerRank, where I tackled a wide range of challenges that helped me enhance my analytical and coding skills.</p>

        <h3>CodeChef</h3>
        <p>On CodeChef, I have worked on numerous problems that required a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. This platform has allowed me to practice my skills in real-time coding contests, where I learned to optimize my solutions for better performance. I particularly enjoy challenges that involve dynamic programming and graph algorithms, as they push me to think critically and creatively.</p>

        <h3>HackerRank</h3>
        <p>HackerRank has been another significant platform in my problem-solving journey. Here, I have completed various challenges across multiple domains, including algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and more. The structured learning paths on HackerRank have enabled me to systematically improve my skills and tackle progressively complex problems. I appreciate the immediate feedback and the opportunity to learn from other users' solutions.</p>

        <p>Overall, my experiences on these platforms have not only sharpened my coding abilities but also instilled a deep understanding of algorithmic thinking. I believe that continuous practice in problem-solving is essential for mastering data structures and algorithms, and I am committed to pursuing this path as I progress in my studies and career.</p>
