        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ramsundar, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in my second year at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST). My journey in engineering has been an exciting blend of learning, creativity, and personal growth. I am passionate about technology and have a keen interest in software development, particularly in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>

        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have been exposed to various programming languages and tools that have helped me enhance my problem-solving abilities. I am particularly fascinated by how algorithms work behind the scenes, powering everything from simple applications to complex systems. My goal is to gain a strong foundation in computer science principles that will enable me to tackle real-world challenges.</p>

        <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I enjoy participating in coding competitions and hackathons. These experiences have not only honed my coding skills but have also taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving common goals. I believe that continuous learning and practical experience are vital for success in the tech industry.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I love exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, and working on personal projects that allow me to apply my knowledge creatively. I am also an avid learner, always seeking opportunities to expand my skills and understanding of emerging trends in technology.</p>

        <p>As I continue my journey through B.Tech, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am committed to making a positive impact in the field of technology.</p>
